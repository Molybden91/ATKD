Programs for measurements and calculation experiment data of the following types:
1)Ordinary data:
-Temperature
-3 harmonics of pressure
-Pressure amplitude
-3 harmonics of temperature responce
-Temperature responce amplitude

2)Ordinary data with temperature control:
-Temperature
-3 harmonics of pressure
-Pressure amplitude
-3 harmonics of temperature responce
-Temperature responce amplitude
-Accurate temperature measurement 

3)Ordinary data with temperature responce from SRS810 (measured with help of GPIB):
-Temperature
-3 harmonics of pressure
-Pressure amplitude
-Temperature responce amplitude (from SRS810 with GPIB)

4)Ordinary data with temperature control and temperature responce from SRS810 (measured with help of GPIB):
-Temperature
-3 harmonics of pressure
-Pressure amplitude
-Temperature responce amplitude (from SRS810 with GPIB)
-Accurate temperature measurement 

5)Data with raw temperature data (100000 samples per second):
-Temperature
-Pressure amplitude
-Temperature responce amplitude
-Two files: with 3 parameters and big file with raw temperature data
